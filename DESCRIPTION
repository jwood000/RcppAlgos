Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'
    for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    There is a combination function and a permutation function that are
    both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and memory.
    There are optional contraint arguments that when employed, generate
    all combinations/permutations of a vector meeting a specific criteria
    (E.g. finding all combinations such that the sum is less than a
    bound). Additionally, there are various sieving functions that quickly
    generate essential components for problems common in computational
    mathematics (E.g. number of comprime elements, divisors, prime
    factorizations, and complete factorizations for many numbers as well
    as generating primes in a range).
