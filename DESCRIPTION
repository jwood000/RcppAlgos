Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'.
    There is a generalized combinations function that is highly efficient
    (both speed and memory). There are optional contraint arguments that
    when employed, generate all combinations of a vector meeting a specific
    criteria (E.g. finding all combinations such that the sum is less than
    a bound). Additionally, there are various sieving functions that quickly
    generate essential components for problems common in computational
    mathematics (E.g. number of comprime elements, divisors, prime
    factorizations, and complete factorizations for many numbers as well
    as generating primes in a range).
