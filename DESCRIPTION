Package: RcppAlgos
Version: 0.1.0
Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description:
    The 'RcppAlgos’ package contains optimized functions implemented in
    C++ with Rcpp. There is a generalized combinations function that is
    highly efficient (both speed and memory). There are optional contraint
    arguments that when employed, generate all combinations of a vector
    meeting a specific criteria (E.g. Finding all combinations such that
    the sum is less than a bound). Additionally, there are various sieving
    functions that quickly generate essential components for problems 
    common in computational mathematics. E.g. Number of comprime elements,
    divisors, prime factorizations, and complete factorizations for many
    numbers as well as generating primes in a range.
