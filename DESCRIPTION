Title: High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions and flexible iterators implemented in
    C++ for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    Handles various combinatorial objects including combinations, permutations,
    integer partitions and compositions, subset-sum, Cartestion products,
    unordered Cartesian products, and partition of groups. Utilizes the RMatrix
    class from 'RcppParallel' for thread safety. The combination and
    permutation functions contain constraint parameters that allow for
    generation of all results of a vector meeting specific criteria (e.g.
    finding all combinations such that the sum is between two bounds). Capable
    of ranking/unranking combinatorial objects efficiently (e.g. retrieve only
    the nth lexicographical result) which sets up nicely for parallelization as
    well as random sampling. Gmp support permits exploration where the total
    number of results is large (e.g. comboSample(10000, 500, n = 4)).
    Additionally, there are several high performance number theoretic
    functions that are useful for problems common in computational mathematics.
    Some of these functions make use of the fast integer division library
    'libdivide'. The primeSieve function is based on the segmented sieve of
    Eratosthenes implementation by Kim Walisch. It is also efficient for large
    numbers by using the cache friendly improvements originally developed by
    TomÃ¡s Oliveira. Finally, there is a prime counting function that implements
    Legendre's formula based on the work of Kim Walisch.
