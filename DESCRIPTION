Title: High Performance Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'
    for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    Utilizes parallel programming via 'RcppThread' for maximal performance.
    Also makes use of the RMatrix class from the 'RcppParallel' library.
    There are combination/permutation functions with constraint parameters
    that allow for generation of all combinations/permutations of a vector
    meeting specific criteria (e.g. finding all combinations such
    that the sum is between two bounds). Capable of generating specific
    combinations/permutations (e.g. retrieve only the nth lexicographical
    result) which sets up nicely for parallelization as well as random
    sampling. Gmp support permits exploration where the total number of
    results is large (e.g. comboSample(10000, 500, n = 4)). Additionally,
    there are several high performance number theoretic functions that
    are useful for problems common in computational mathematics. Some of
    these functions make use of the fast integer division library
    'libdivide' by <http://ridiculousfish.com>. The primeSieve function
    is based on the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes implementation by
    Kim Walisch. It is also efficient for large numbers by using the
    cache friendly improvements originally developed by TomÃ¡s Oliveira.
    Finally, there is a prime counting function that implements Legendre's
    formula based on the algorithm by Kim Walisch.
