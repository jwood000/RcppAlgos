This document serves as an overview for attacking _common_ combinatorial problems in `R`. One of the goals of `RcppAlgos` is to provide a comprehensive and accessible suite of functionality so that users can easily get to the heart of their problem. As a bonus, the functions in `RcppAlgos` are extremely efficient and are constantly being improved with every release. 

It should be noted that this document only covers common problems. For more information on other combinatorial problems addressed by `RcppAlgos`, see the following vignettes:

* [Combinatorial Sampling](<https://jwood000.github.io/RcppAlgos/articles/CombinatorialSampling.html>)
* [Constraints, Integer Partitions, and Compositions](<https://jwood000.github.io/RcppAlgos/articles/CombPermConstraints.html>)
* [Attacking Problems Related to the Subset Sum Problem](<https://jwood000.github.io/RcppAlgos/articles/SubsetSum.html>)

For much of the output below, we will be using the following function obtained here [combining head and tail methods in R
](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11601162/4408538) (credit to user @flodel)

```r
ht <- function(d, m = 5, n = m) {
  ## print the head and tail together
  cat("head -->\n")
  print(head(d, m))
  cat("--------\n")
  cat("tail -->\n")
  print(tail(d, n))
}
```

## Introducing `comboGeneral` and `permuteGeneral`

Easily executed with a very simple interface. The output is in [lexicographical order](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order>).

We first look at getting results without repetition. You can pass an integer *n* and it will be converted to the sequence `1:n`, or you can pass any vector with an atomic type (i.e. `logical`, `integer`, `numeric`, `complex`, `character`, and `raw`).

```r
library(RcppAlgos)

## combn output for reference
combn(4, 3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    1    1    2
[2,]    2    2    3    3
[3,]    3    4    4    4

## This is the same as combn expect the output is transposed
comboGeneral(4, 3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    1    2    4
[3,]    1    3    4
[4,]    2    3    4

## Find all 3-tuple permutations without
## repetition of the numbers c(1, 2, 3, 4).
head(permuteGeneral(4, 3))

[4,]    1    3    4
[5,]    1    4    2
[6,]    1    4    3

## If you don't specify m, the length of v (if v is a vector) or v (if v is a 
## scalar (see the examples above)) will be used
v <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)
comboGeneral(v)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    2    3    5    7   11   13

```

## Combinations/Permutations with Repetition

There are many problems in combinatorics which require finding combinations/permutations with repetition. This is easily achieved by setting `repetition` to `TRUE`.

```r
fourDays <- weekdays(as.Date("2019-10-09") + 0:3, TRUE)
ht(comboGeneral(fourDays, repetition = TRUE))
head -->
     [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4] 
[1,] "Wed" "Wed" "Wed" "Wed"
[2,] "Wed" "Wed" "Wed" "Thu"
[3,] "Wed" "Wed" "Wed" "Fri"
[4,] "Wed" "Wed" "Wed" "Sat"
[5,] "Wed" "Wed" "Thu" "Thu"
--------
tail -->
      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4] 
[31,] "Fri" "Fri" "Fri" "Fri"
[32,] "Fri" "Fri" "Fri" "Sat"
[33,] "Fri" "Fri" "Sat" "Sat"
[34,] "Fri" "Sat" "Sat" "Sat"
[35,] "Sat" "Sat" "Sat" "Sat"

## When repetition = TRUE, m can exceed length(v)

```

## Working with Multisets

Sometimes, the standard combination/permutation functions don't quite get us to our desired goal. For
example, one may need all permutations of a vector with some of the elements repeated a specific
number of times (i.e. a multiset). Consider the following vector `a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7)` and one
would like to find permutations of `a` of length 6. Using traditional methods, we would need to generate all
permutations, then eliminate duplicate values. Even considering that `permuteGeneral` is very efficient,
this approach is clunky and not as fast as it could be. Observe:

``` r
getPermsWithSpecificRepetition <- function(z, n) {
    b <- permuteGeneral(z, n)
    myDupes <- duplicated(b)
    b[!myDupes, ]
}

a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7)

system.time(test <- getPermsWithSpecificRepetition(a, 6))
  user  system elapsed 
 2.317   0.059   2.385
```

### Enter `freqs`

Situations like this call for the use of the `freqs` argument. Simply, enter the number
of times each unique element is repeated and Voila!

``` r
system.time(test2 <- permuteGeneral(unique(a), 6, freqs = rle(a)$lengths))
 user  system elapsed 
    0       0       0
      
identical(test, test2)
[1] TRUE
```
 
Here are some more general examples with multisets:
 
```r
## Generate all permutations of a vector with specific
## length of repetition for each element (i.e. multiset)
ht(permuteGeneral(3, freqs = c(1,2,2)))
head -->
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    2    2    3    3
[2,]    1    2    3    2    3
[3,]    1    2    3    3    2
[4,]    1    3    2    2    3
[5,]    1    3    2    3    2
--------
tail -->
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[26,]    3    2    3    1    2
[27,]    3    2    3    2    1
[28,]    3    3    1    2    2
[29,]    3    3    2    1    2
[30,]    3    3    2    2    1

## or combinations of a certain length
comboGeneral(3, 2, freqs = c(1,2,2))
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    1    3
[3,]    2    2
[4,]    2    3
[5,]    3    3
```

## Parallel Computing

Using the parameter `Parallel` or `nThreads`, we can generate combinations/permutations with greater efficiency.

```r
library(microbenchmark)

## RcppAlgos uses the "number of threads available minus one" when Parallel is TRUE
RcppAlgos::stdThreadMax()
[1] 8

## Compared to combn using 4 threads
microbenchmark(combn = combn(25, 10),
               serAlgos = comboGeneral(25, 10),
               parAlgos = comboGeneral(25, 10, nThreads = 4),
               times = 10, 
               unit = "relative")
Unit: relative
     expr        min         lq      mean     median         uq       max neval

## Using 7 cores w/ Parallel = TRUE
microbenchmark(serial = comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5)),
             parallel = comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5), Parallel = TRUE))
Unit: milliseconds
     expr       min         lq      mean     median         uq       max neval

set.seed(2187)
bigVec <- sort(sample(10^7, 600))

## Use it with any of the combinatorial functions
system.time(permuteGeneral(bigVec, 3, Parallel = T))
  user  system elapsed
 1.067   3.645   0.902
 
prettyNum(permuteCount(bigVec, 3), big.mark = ",")
[1] "214,921,200"
```

### Using arguments `lower` and `upper`

There are arguments `lower` and `upper` that can be utilized to generate chunks of combinations/permutations without having to generate all of them followed by subsetting.  As the output is in lexicographical order, these arguments specify where to start and stop generating. For example, `comboGeneral(5, 3)` outputs 10 combinations of the vector `1:5` chosen 3 at a time. We can set `lower` to 5 in order to start generation from the _5<sup>th</sup>_ lexicographical combination. Similarly, we can set `upper` to 4 in order to only generate the first 4 combinations. We can also use them together to produce only a certain chunk of combinations. For example, setting `lower` to 4 and `upper` to 6 only produces the _4<sup>th</sup>_, _5<sup>th</sup>_, and _6<sup>th</sup>_ lexicographical combinations. Observe:

``` r
comboGeneral(5, 3, lower = 4, upper = 6)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    4
[2,]    1    3    5
[3,]    1    4    5

## is equivalent to the following:
comboGeneral(5, 3)[4:6, ]
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    4
[2,]    1    3    5
[3,]    1    4    5
```

### Generating Results Beyond `.Machine$integer.max`

In addition to being useful by avoiding the unnecessary overhead of generating all combination/permutations followed by subsetting just to see a few specific results, `lower` and `upper` can be utilized to generate large number of combinations/permutations in parallel (see this [stackoverflow post](<https://stackoverflow.com/a/51595866/4408538>) for a real use case). Observe:

``` r
## Over 3 billion results
comboCount(35, 15)
[1] 3247943160

## 10086780 evenly divides 3247943160, otherwise you need to ensure that
## upper does not exceed the total number of results (E.g. see below, we
## would have "if ((x + foo) > 3247943160) {myUpper = 3247943160}" where
## foo is the size of the increment you choose to use in seq()).

system.time(lapply(seq(1, 3247943160, 10086780), function(x) {
     temp <- comboGeneral(35, 15, lower = x, upper = x + 10086779)
     ## do something
     x
}))
   user  system elapsed 
 99.495  49.993 149.467


## Enter parallel
library(parallel)
system.time(mclapply(seq(1, 3247943160, 10086780), function(x) {
     temp <- comboGeneral(35, 15, lower = x, upper = x + 10086779)
     ## do something
     x
}, mc.cores = 6))
   user  system elapsed 
125.361  85.916  35.641
```

## GMP Support

The arguments `lower` and `upper` are also useful when one needs to explore combinations/permutations where the number of results is large:

```r
set.seed(222)
myVec <- rnorm(1000)

## HUGE number of combinations
comboCount(myVec, 50, repetition = TRUE)
Big Integer ('bigz') :
[1] 109740941767310814894854141592555528130828577427079559745647393417766593803205094888320

## Let's look at one hundred thousand combinations in the range (1e15 + 1, 1e15 + 1e5)

## User Defined Functions

You can also pass user defined functions by utilizing the argument `FUN`. This feature's main purpose is for convenience, however it is somewhat more efficient than generating all combinations/permutations and then using a function from the `apply` family (N.B. the argument `Parallel` has no effect when `FUN` is employed).

```r
funCustomComb = function(n, r) {
    combs = comboGeneral(n, r)
    lapply(1:nrow(combs), function(x) cumprod(combs[x,]))
}

identical(funCustomComb(15, 8), comboGeneral(15, 8, FUN = cumprod))
[1] TRUE

microbenchmark(f1 = funCustomComb(15, 8),
               f2 = comboGeneral(15, 8, FUN = cumprod), unit = "relative")
unit: relative

                    freqs = c(2, rep(1, 3)),

## Partitions of Groups of Equal Size with `comboGroups`

Given a vector of length _n_ and _k_ groups, where _k_ divides _n_, each group is comprised of a combination of the vector chosen _g = n / k_ at a time. As is stated in the documentation (see `?comboGroups`), these can be constructed by first generating all permutations of the vector and subsequently removing entries with permuted groups. Let us consider the following example. Given `v = 1:12`, generate all partitions `v` into 3 groups each of size 4.

```r
funBruteGrp <- function(myLow = 1, myUp) {
    mat <- do.call(rbind, permuteGeneral(12, lower = myLow, upper = myUp,
        FUN = function(x) {
        sapply(seq(0, 8, 4), function(y) {
            paste0(c("(", x[(y + 1):(y + 4)], ")"), collapse = " ")
        })
    }))
    colnames(mat) <- paste0("Grp", 1:3)
    rownames(mat) <- myLow:myUp
    mat
}

## All of these are the same as only the 3rd group is being permuted
funBruteGrp(myUp = 6)
  Grp1          Grp2          Grp3            
1 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 10 11 12 )"
2 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 10 12 11 )"
3 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 11 10 12 )"
4 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 11 12 10 )"
5 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 12 10 11 )"
6 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 9 12 11 10 )"

## We found our second distinct partition
funBruteGrp(myLow = 23, myUp = 26)
   Grp1          Grp2          Grp3            
23 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 12 11 9 10 )"
24 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )" "( 12 11 10 9 )"
25 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 9 )" "( 8 10 11 12 )"  ## <<-- 2nd distinct partition of groups
26 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 9 )" "( 8 10 12 11 )"

funBruteGrp(myLow = 48, myUp = 50)
   Grp1          Grp2           Grp3            
48 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 9 )"  "( 12 11 10 8 )"
49 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 10 )" "( 8 9 11 12 )"  ## <<-- 3rd distinct partition of groups
50 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 10 )" "( 8 9 12 11 )" 
```

We are starting to see a pattern. Each new partition is exactly 24 spots away. This makes sense as there are `factorial(4) = 24` permutations of size 4. Now, this is an oversimplification as if we simply generate every _24<sup>th</sup>_ permutation, we will still get duplication as they start to carry over to the other groups. Observe:

```r
do.call(rbind, lapply(seq(1, 145, 24), function(x) {
    funBruteGrp(myLow = x, myUp = x)
}))
Grp1          Grp2           Grp3            
1   "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 8 )"  "( 9 10 11 12 )"
25  "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 9 )"  "( 8 10 11 12 )"
49  "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 10 )" "( 8 9 11 12 )" 
73  "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 11 )" "( 8 9 10 12 )" 
97  "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 7 12 )" "( 8 9 10 11 )" 
121 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 8 7 )"  "( 9 10 11 12 )"  ## <<-- This is the same as the 1st
145 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 8 9 )"  "( 7 10 11 12 )"  ## partition. The only difference is
169 "( 1 2 3 4 )" "( 5 6 8 10 )" "( 7 9 11 12 )"   ## that the 2nd Grp has been permuted
```

This only gets more muddled as the number of groups increases. It is also very inefficient, however this exercise hopefully serves to better illustrate these structures. 

The algorithm in `comboGroups` avoids all of this duplication by implementing a novel algorithm akin to [std::next_permutation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation) from the algorithm library in `C++`.

```
system.time(comboGroups(12, numGroups = 3))

      0       0       0

Just as in `combo/permuteGeneral`, we can utilize the arguments `lower`, `upper`, `Parallel`, and `nThreads`.

```r
comboGroupsCount(30, 6)
Big Integer ('bigz') :
[1] 123378675083039376

system.time(a1 <- comboGroups(30, numGroups = 6, 
                              lower = "123378675000000000",
                              upper = "123378675005000000"))

                              lower = "123378675000000000",
                              upper = "123378675005000000", nThreads = 4))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.358   0.197   0.146

## Use n - 1 number of threads (in this case, there are 7)
system.time(a3 <- comboGroups(30, numGroups = 6, 
                              lower = "123378675000000000",
                              upper = "123378675005000000", Parallel = TRUE))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.466   0.307   0.118
  
identical(a1, a2)

identical(a1, a3)

```

There is one additional argument (i.e. `retType`) not present in the other two general functions that allows the user to specify the type of object returned. The user can select between `"matrix"` (the default) and `"3Darray"`. This structure has a natural connection to 3D space. We have a particular result (_1<sup>st</sup>_ dimension) broken down into groups (_2<sup>nd</sup>_ dimension) of a certain size (_3<sup>rd</sup>_ dimension).

```r
my3D <- comboGroups(factor(month.abb), 4, retType = "3Darray")
my3D[1, , ]
     Grp1 Grp2 Grp3 Grp4
[1,] Jan  Apr  Jul  Oct 
[2,] Feb  May  Aug  Nov 
[3,] Mar  Jun  Sep  Dec

comboGroupsCount(12, 4)
[1] 15400

my3D[15400, , ]
     Grp1 Grp2 Grp3 Grp4
