This document serves as an overview for solving problems common in [Computational Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics). Of note, `primeSieve` and `primeCount` are based on the excellent work by [Kim Walisch](<https://github.com/kimwalisch>).

***

## `primeSieve`

The primeSieve function is based on the [Segmented Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Segmented_sieve). As stated in the linked article, the sieve itself is already very efficient. The problem from an efficiency standpoint, is due to the memory requirements. The segmented version overcomes this by only sieving small sections at a time, which greatly facilitates use of the cache.

```r
library(RcppAlgos)
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(primeSieve(1e6))
Unit: milliseconds
              expr      min       lq    mean   median       uq      max neval
 primeSieve(1e+06) 1.151969 1.175597 1.28727 1.264687 1.316879 1.687415   100

## order for the bounds does not matter.

### Larger primes

Since version `2.3.0`, we are implementing the cache-friendly improvements for larger primes originally developed by [TomÃ¡s Oliveira](<http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/software/prime_sieve.html>).

```r
## Version <= 2.2.0.. i.e. older versions
system.time(old <- RcppAlgos2.2::primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9))
   user  system elapsed 
  7.615   0.140   7.792

## v2.3.0 is over 3x faster!  
system.time(a <- primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9))
   user  system elapsed 
  2.237   0.183   2.420
  
## And using nThreads we are ~8x faster
system.time(b <- primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9, nThreads = 8))
   user  system elapsed 
  4.872   0.807   0.917
  
identical(a, b)
[1] TRUE

identical(a, old)
[1] TRUE
```

## `primeCount`

The library by Kim Walisch relies on [OpenMP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP>) for parallel computation with [Legendre's Formula](<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendresFormula.html>). Currently, the default compiler on `macOS` is `clang`, which does not support `OpenMP`. James Balamuta (a.k.a. TheCoatlessProfessor... well at least [we think so](<https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/about/>)) has written a great article on this topic, which you can find here: <https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/openmp-in-r-on-os-x/>. One of the goals of `RcppAlgos` is to be accessible by all users. With this in mind, we set out to count primes in parallel _without_ `OpenMP`.

At first glance, this seems trivial as we have a function in `Primes.cpp` called `phiWorker` that counts the primes up to `x`. If you look in [phi.cpp](<https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/blob/master/src/phi.cpp>) in the `primecount` library by Kim Walisch, we see that `OpenMP` does its magic on a for loop that makes repeated calls to `phi` (which is what `phiWorker` is based on). All we need to do is break this loop into _n_ intervals where _n_ is the number of threads. Simple, right?

We can certainly do this, but what you will find is that _n - 1_ threads will complete very quickly and the _n<sup>th</sup>_ thread will be left with a heavy computation. In order to alleviate this unbalanced load, we take advantage of thread pooling provided by `RcppThread` which allows us to reuse threads efficiently as well as breaking up the loop mentioned above into smaller intervals. The idea is to completely calculate `phi` up to a limit _m_ using all _n_ threads and then gradually increase _m_. The advantage here is that we are benefiting greatly from the caching done by the work of the previous _n_ threads.

With this is mind, here are some results:

```r  
## Enumerate the number of primes below trillion
system.time(underOneTrillion <- primeCount(10^12))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.478   0.000   0.480
  
underOneTrillion
[1] 37607912018


## Enumerate the number of primes below a billion in 2 milliseconds
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(primeCount(10^9))
Unit: milliseconds
             expr       min      lq    mean   median       uq      max neval
 primeCount(10^9) 1.93462 1.938516 2.044785 1.957809 2.090828 3.584245   100
 

system.time(underOneHundredTrillion <- primeCount(1e14, nThreads = 8))
   user  system elapsed 
 49.894   0.102   6.774

```

## Other Sieving Functions

`RcppAlgos` comes equipped with several functions for quickly generating essential components
for problems common in computational mathematics. All functions below can be executed in parallel by using the argument `nThreads`.

The following sieving functions (`primeFactorizeSieve`, `divisorsSieve`, `numDivisorSieve`, & `eulerPhiSieve`) are very useful and flexible. Generate components up to a number or between two bounds.

```r
## get the number of divisors for every number from 1 to n
numDivisorSieve(20)
 [1] 1 2 2 3 2 4 2 4 3 4 2 6 2 4 4 5 2 6 2 6

## If you want the complete factorization from 1 to n, use divisorsList
system.time(allFacs <- divisorsSieve(10^5, namedList = TRUE))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.040   0.003   0.043

## Vectorized Functions

There are three very fast vectorized functions for general factoring (e.g. all divisors of number), primality testing, as well as prime factoring (`divisorsRcpp`, `isPrimeRcpp`, `primeFactorize`).

```r
## get result for individual numbers
primeFactorize(123456789)
[1]    3    3 3607 3803


## or for an entire vector
set.seed(100)
