# RcppAlgos

## Overview

A collection of high performance functions implemented in C++ with Rcpp for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics. Utilizes the library [RcppThread](<https://github.com/tnagler/RcppThread>) where multithreading is needed. We also make use of the [RMatrix.h](<https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppParallel/blob/master/inst/include/RcppParallel/RMatrix.h>) header file from [RcppParallel](<https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppParallel>) for thread safe accessors for Rcpp matrices. Featured functions:

### comboGeneral/permuteGeneral

* Generate all combinations/permutations of a vector (including [multisets](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset>)) meeting specific criteria.
* A special generalized partition function is employed when `constraintFun = "sum"`, `comparisonFun = "=="`, and the vector passed has the quality that if you were to sort them, the difference of each element with it's neighbor is constant (E.g. `c(100, 105, 110, 115, ..., 130)`).
```r
system.time(genParts <- comboGeneral(seq(121, 221, 5), 13, TRUE,
                                     constraintFun = "sum", 
                                     comparisonFun = "==", 
                                     limitConstraints = 2223))
   user  system elapsed     
  0.945   0.619   1.577    ### very fast... finds all 8300708 results under 2 seconds
```
* Produce results in parallel using the `Parallel` argument. You can also apply each of the five compiled functions given by the argument `constraintFun` in parallel as well. E.g. Obtaining the row sums of all combinations.
``` r
system.time(parCombsSum <- comboGeneral(30, 10, constraintFun = "sum", Parallel = TRUE))
   user  system elapsed 
  1.103   0.576   0.268    ## over 30 million combinations and row sums
```

* Alternatively, the arguments `lower` and `upper` make it possible to generate combinations/permutations in chunks allowing for parallelization via the package `parallel`. This is convenient when you want to apply a custom function to the output in parallel as well (see this [stackoverflow post](<https://stackoverflow.com/a/51595866/4408538>) for a use case).
* GMP support allows for exploration of combinations/permutations of vectors with many elements.
    
### comboSample/permuteSample

* Easily generate random samples of combinations/permutations in parallel.
* You can pass a vector of specific indices or rely on the internal sampling functions. We call `sample` when the total number of results is small and for larger cases, the sampling is done in a very similar fashion to `urand.bigz` from the `gmp` package.
    
### primeSieve

* Generates all primes less than a **billion in under 0.5 seconds.**
``` r
system.time(b <- primeSieve(10^9, nThreads = 8))
 user  system elapsed 
2.339   0.047   0.418
```

* It is also efficient for large numbers by using the cache friendly improvements originally developed by [TomÃ¡s Oliveira](<http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/software/prime_sieve.html>).
``` r
system.time(b <- primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9, nThreads = 8))
 user  system elapsed 
5.054   0.754   0.977
```

### primeCount

* Counts the number of primes below a **1e12 in ~130 milliseconds** and **1e15 in under 50 seconds.**
```r
system.time(primeCount(1e12, nThreads = 8))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.804   0.005   0.127
```

The `primeSieve` function and the `primeCount` function are both based off of the excellent work by [Kim Walisch](<https://github.com/kimwalisch>). The respective repos can be found here: [kimwalisch/primesieve](<https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve>); [kimwalisch/primecount](<https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount>)

Additionally, many of the sieving functions make use of the fast integer division library [libdivide](<https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide>) by [ridiculousfish](<https://github.com/ridiculousfish>).

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("RcppAlgos")

## Or install the development version
devtools::install_github("jwood000/RcppAlgos")
```

## Usage

### Common Combinatorial Functions

Easily executed with a very simple interface. Output is in [lexicographical order](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order>).
``` r
## Find all 3-tuples combinations without 
## repetition of the numbers c(1, 2, 3, 4).
comboGeneral(4, 3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   1    2    3
[2,]   1    2    4
[3,]   1    3    4
[4,]   2    3    4


## Find all 3-tuples permutations without
## repetition of the numbers c(1, 2, 3, 4).
permuteGeneral(4, 3)
      [,1] [,2] [,3]
 [1,]    1    2    3
 [2,]    1    2    4
 [3,]    1    3    2
 [4,]    1    3    4
  .      .    .    .
  .      .    .    .
[21,]    4    2    1
[22,]    4    2    3
[23,]    4    3    1
[24,]    4    3    2

## For combinations/permutations with repetition, simply
## set the repetition argument to TRUE
comboGeneral(4, 3, repetition = TRUE)
      [,1] [,2] [,3]
 [1,]    1    1    1
 [2,]    1    1    2
 [3,]    1    1    3
  .      .    .    .
  .      .    .    .
  
## They are very efficient
system.time(comboGeneral(25, 13))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.116   0.062   0.178

system.time(comboGeneral(25, 13, nThreads = 8))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.192   0.228   0.058

nrow(comboGeneral(25,13))
[1] 5200300
```

### Using Constraints

Oftentimes, one needs to find combinations/permutations that meet certain requirements.

``` r
## Generate some random data
set.seed(101)
s <- sample(500, 20)
## Find all 5-tuples permutations without repetition
## of s (defined above) such that the sum is equal to 1176.
p <- permuteGeneral(v = s,
                    m = 5, 
                    constraintFun = "sum", 
                    comparisonFun = "==", 
                    limitConstraints = 1176,
                    keepResults = TRUE)
 
tail(p)
        [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[3955,]  354  287  149  187  199 1176
[3956,]  354  287  149  199  187 1176
[3957,]  354  287  187  149  199 1176
[3958,]  354  287  187  199  149 1176
[3959,]  354  287  199  149  187 1176
[3960,]  354  287  199  187  149 1176


## Get combinations such that the product is between
## 3600 and 4000 (including 3600 but not 4000)
comboGeneral(5, 7, TRUE, constraintFun = "prod",
             comparisonFun = c(">=","<"),
             limitConstraints = c(3600, 4000),
             keepResults = TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]
[1,]    1    2    3    5    5    5    5 3750
[2,]    1    3    3    4    4    5    5 3600
[3,]    1    3    4    4    4    4    5 3840
[4,]    2    2    3    3    4    5    5 3600
[5,]    2    2    3    4    4    4    5 3840
[6,]    3    3    3    3    3    3    5 3645
[7,]    3    3    3    3    3    4    4 3888
```

### Working with Multisets

Sometimes, the standard combination/permutation functions don't quite get us to our desired goals. For
example, one may need all permutations of a vector with some of the elements repeated a specific
amount of times (i.e. a multiset). Consider the following vector `a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7)` and one
would like to find permutations of `a` of length 6. Using traditional methods, we would need to generate all
permutations, then eliminate duplicate values. Even considering that `permuteGeneral` is very efficient,
this approach is clunky and not as fast as it could be. Observe:

``` r
getPermsWithSpecificRepetition <- function(z, n) {
    b <- permuteGeneral(z, n)
    myDupes <- duplicated(apply(b, 1, paste, collapse=""))
    b[!myDupes, ]
}

a <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7)

system.time(test <- getPermsWithSpecificRepetition(a, 6))
   user  system elapsed 
  4.168   0.046   4.230
```

#### Enter _freqs_

Situations like this call for the use of the `freqs` argument. Simply, enter the number
of times each unique element is repeated and Voila!

``` r
system.time(test2 <- permuteGeneral(unique(a), 6, freqs = rle(a)$lengths))
   user  system elapsed 
      0       0       0
      
identical(test, test2)
[1] TRUE
```
 
 Here are some more general examples with multisets:
 
``` r
## Generate all permutations of a vector with specific
## length of repetition for each element (i.e. multiset)
permuteGeneral(3, freqs = c(1,2,2))
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
 [1,]    1    2    2    3    3
 [2,]    1    2    3    2    3
 [3,]    1    2    3    3    2
 [4,]    1    3    2    2    3
 [5,]    1    3    2    3    2
  .      .    .    .    .    .
  .      .    .    .    .    .
[26,]    3    2    3    1    2
[27,]    3    2    3    2    1
[28,]    3    3    1    2    2
[29,]    3    3    2    1    2
[30,]    3    3    2    2    1

## or combinations of a certain length
comboGeneral(3, 2, freqs = c(1,2,2), constraintFun = "prod")
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    2
[2,]    1    3    3
[3,]    2    2    4
[4,]    2    3    6
[5,]    3    3    9
```

##### All Combinatorial Functions Work with Factors

``` r
facPerms <- permuteGeneral(factor(c("low", "med", "high"),
                                   levels = c("low", "med", "high"),
                                   ordered = TRUE),
                                   freqs = c(1,4,2))
> facPerms[1:5, ]
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7]
[1,] low  med  med  med  med  high high
[2,] low  med  med  med  high med  high
[3,] low  med  med  med  high high med 
[4,] low  med  med  high med  med  high
[5,] low  med  med  high med  high med 
Levels: low < med < high
```

### Parallel Computing

Using the parameter `Parallel`, we can easily generate combinations/permutations with great efficiency.

```r
## RcppAlgos uses the number of cores available minus one
RcppAlgos::stdThreadMax()
[1] 8

identical(comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5)),
          comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5), Parallel = TRUE))
[1] TRUE

## Using 7 cores
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(serial = comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5)),
             parallel = comboGeneral(20, 10, freqs = rep(1:4, 5), Parallel = TRUE))
Unit: milliseconds
     expr       min        lq      mean    median        uq      max neval
   serial 224.77650 239.09760 243.50147 241.41096 244.00927 292.3136   100
 parallel  80.21005  82.16222  84.74438  84.42145  85.58884 123.5970   100
```

And applying any of the constraint functions in parallel is highly efficient as well. Consider obtaining the row sums of all combinations:

```r
## base R using combn and FUN
combnSum <- combn(20, 10, sum)
algosSum <- comboGeneral(20, 10, constraintFun = "sum")

identical(as.integer(combnSum), algosSum[,11])
[1] TRUE

## Using parallel
paralSum <- comboGeneral(20, 10, constraintFun = "sum", Parallel = TRUE)
identical(paralSum, algosSum)
[1] TRUE

microbenchmark(serial = comboGeneral(20, 10, constraintFun = "sum"),
             parallel = comboGeneral(20, 10, constraintFun = "sum", Parallel = TRUE),
             combnSum = combn(20, 10, sum))
Unit: milliseconds
     expr        min         lq       mean     median         uq        max neval
   serial   3.108999   3.470917   4.394282   3.798261   4.345005   8.038390   100
 parallel   1.186217   1.377346   1.786400   1.454697   1.588850   3.564296   100
 combnSum 197.533911 213.208303 220.711443 217.775698 226.261102 266.828690   100
```

### Faster than `rowSums` and `rowMeans`

In fact, finding row sums or row means is even faster than simply applying the highly efficient `rowSums`/`rowMeans` after the combinations have already been generated:
```r
## Pre-generate combinations
combs <- comboGeneral(25, 10)

## Testing rowSums alone against generating combinations as well as summing
microbenchmark(serial = comboGeneral(25, 10, constraintFun = "sum"),
             parallel = comboGeneral(25, 10, constraintFun = "sum", Parallel = TRUE),
              rowsums = rowSums(combs))
Unit: milliseconds
     expr       min        lq      mean    median        uq       max neval
   serial 113.05467 117.46261 127.46829 124.99978 135.67496 176.68228   100
 parallel  39.97370  42.79960  49.36836  44.65376  56.82488  67.95255   100
  rowsums  97.18933  98.62043 107.64972 104.80272 113.32359 144.27974   100

all.equal(rowSums(combs), 
          comboGeneral(25, 10, 
                       constraintFun = "sum",
                       Parallel = TRUE)[,11])
[1] TRUE

## Testing rowMeans alone against generating combinations as well as obtain row means
microbenchmark(serial = comboGeneral(25, 10, constraintFun = "mean"),
             parallel = comboGeneral(25, 10, constraintFun = "mean", Parallel = TRUE),
             rowmeans = rowMeans(combs))
Unit: milliseconds
     expr       min       lq      mean    median        uq      max neval
   serial 171.22701 182.2575 198.14229 198.29388 213.14787 240.1016   100
 parallel  54.41817  59.2010  73.12819  74.61183  77.93679 119.8481   100
 rowmeans 102.34084 103.2962 115.09863 107.12878 120.19177 174.8596   100
 
all.equal(rowMeans(combs), 
          comboGeneral(25, 10, 
                       constraintFun = "mean",
                       Parallel = TRUE)[,11])
[1] TRUE
```
In both cases above, `RcppAlgos` is doing double the work nearly twice as fast!!!

### Using arguments `lower` and `upper`

There are arguments `lower` and `upper` that can be utilized to generate chunks of combinations/permutations without having to generate all of them followed by subsetting.  As the output is in lexicographical order, these arguments specify where to start and stop generating. For example, `comboGeneral(5, 3)` outputs 10 combinations of the vector `1:5` chosen 3 at a time. We can set `lower` to 5 in order to start generation from the 5<sup>th</sup> lexicographical combination. Similarly, we can set `upper` to 4 in order only generate the first 4 combinations. We can also use them together to produce only a certain chunk of combinations. For example, setting `lower` to 4 and `upper` to 6 only produces the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> lexicographical combinations. Observe:

``` r
comboGeneral(5, 3, lower = 4, upper = 6)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    4
[2,]    1    3    5
[3,]    1    4    5

## is equivalent to the following:
comboGeneral(5, 3)[4:6, ]
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    4
[2,]    1    3    5
[3,]    1    4    5
```
In addition to being useful by avoiding the unnecessary overhead of generating all combination/permutations followed by subsetting just to see a few specific results, `lower` and `upper` can be utilized to generate large number of combinations/permutations in parallel. Observe:

``` r
## Over 3 billion results
comboCount(35, 15)
[1] 3247943160

## 10086780 evenly divides 3247943160

system.time(lapply(seq(1, 3247943160, 10086780), function(x) {
        temp <- comboGeneral(35, 15, lower = x, upper = x + 10086779)
        ## do something
        x
}))
   user  system elapsed 
 99.495  49.993 149.467

## Enter parallel

library(parallel)
system.time(mclapply(seq(1, 3247943160, 10086780), function(x) {
     temp <- comboGeneral(35, 15, lower = x, upper = x + 10086779)
     ## do something
     x
}, mc.cores = 6))
   user  system elapsed 
125.361  85.916  35.641
```
These arguments are also useful when one needs to explore combinations/permutations of really large vectors:
```r
set.seed(222)
myVec <- rnorm(1000)

## HUGE number of combinations
comboCount(myVec, 50, repetition = TRUE)
Big Integer ('bigz') :
[1] 109740941767310814894854141592555528130828577427079559745647393417766593803205094888320

## Let's look at one hundred thousand combinations in the range (1e15 + 1, 1e15 + 1e5)
system.time(b <- comboGeneral(myVec, 50, TRUE, 
                              lower = 1e15 + 1,
                              upper = 1e15 + 1e5))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.008   0.001   0.010
  
b[1:5, 45:50]
          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]     [,4]      [,5]       [,6]

### Sampling

We can also produce random samples of combinations/permutations with `comboSample` and `permuteSample`. This is really useful when we need a reproducible set of random combinations/permutations. Many of the traditional ways of doing this involved relying on heavy use of `sample` and hoping that we don't generate duplicate results. Both functions have a similar interface to their respective `General` functions. Observe:

``` r
comboSample(10, 8, TRUE, n = 5, seed = 84)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]
[1,]    3    3    3    6    6   10   10   10
[2,]    1    3    3    4    4    7    9   10
[3,]    3    7    7    7    9   10   10   10
[4,]    3    3    3    9   10   10   10   10
[5,]    1    2    2    3    3    4    4    7

## We can also use sampleVec to generate specific results
## E.g. the below generates the 1st, 5th, 25th, 125th, and
## 625th lexicographical combinations
comboSample(10, 8, TRUE, sampleVec = c(1, 5, 25, 125, 625))
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]
[1,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    5
[3,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    3    8
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    3    6    9
[5,]    1    1    1    1    5    6   10   10

## Is the same as:
comboGeneral(10, 8, TRUE)[5^(0:4), ]
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8]
[1,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1
[2,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    5
[3,]    1    1    1    1    1    1    3    8
[4,]    1    1    1    1    1    3    6    9
[5,]    1    1    1    1    5    6   10   10
```
Just like the `General` counterparts (i.e. `combo/permuteGeneral`), we can easily explore combinations/permutations of large vectors where the total number of results is enormous in parallel (using `Parallel` or `nThreads`).
```r
## Uses min(stdThreadMax() - 1, 5) thread (in this case)
permuteSample(500, 10, TRUE, n = 5, seed = 123, Parallel = TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]   55  435  274  324  200  152    6  313  121   377

[5,]  456   76  381  456  219   23  376  187   11   123

permuteSample(factor(state.abb), 15, n = 3, seed = 50, nThreads = 3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14] [,15]

permuteCount(factor(state.abb), 15)

```

### User Defined Functions

You can also pass user defined functions by utilizing the argument `FUN`. This feature's main purpose is for convenience, however it is somewhat more efficient than generating all combinations/permutations and then using a function from the `apply` family (N.B. the argument `Parallel` has no effect when `FUN` is employed).

```r
funCustomComb = function(n, r) {
    combs = comboGeneral(n, r)
    lapply(1:nrow(combs), function(x) cumprod(combs[x,]))
}

identical(funCustomComb(15, 8), comboGeneral(15, 8, FUN = cumprod))
[1] TRUE

library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(f1 = funCustomComb(15, 8),
                f2 = comboGeneral(15, 8, FUN = cumprod), unit = "relative")
unit: relative
 expr      min       lq     mean   median       uq      max neval

## Mathematical Computation

`RcppAlgos` comes equipped with several functions for quickly generating essential components
for problems common in computational mathematics. All functions below can be executed in parallel by using the argument `nThreads`.

The following sieving functions (`primeFactorizeSieve`, `divisorsSieve`, `numDivisorSieve`, & `eulerPhiSieve`) are very useful and flexible. Generate components up to a number or between two bounds.

``` r
## get the number of divisors for every number from 1 to n
numDivisorSieve(20)
 [1] 1 2 2 3 2 4 2 4 3 4 2 6 2 4 4 5 2 6 2 6

## If you want the complete factorization from 1 to n, use divisorsList
system.time(allFacs <- divisorsSieve(10^5, namedList = TRUE))

### Vectorized Functions

There are three very fast vectorized functions for general factoring (e.g. all divisors of number), primality testing, as well as prime factoring (`divisorsRcpp`, `isPrimeRcpp`, `primeFactorize`)

``` r
## get result for individual numbers
primeFactorize(123456789)

### primeSieve & primeCount

Both of these functions are based on the excellent algorithms developed by [Kim Walisch](<https://github.com/kimwalisch>). First `primeSieve`:

``` r
## Quickly generate large primes over small interval

### Larger primes

Since version `2.3.0`, we are implementing the cache-friendly improvements for larger primes originally developed by [TomÃ¡s Oliveira](<http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/software/prime_sieve.html>).

``` r
## Version <= 2.2.0.. i.e. older versions
system.time(old <- RcppAlgos2.2::primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9))
   user  system elapsed 
  7.615   0.140   7.792

## v2.3.0 is over 3x faster!  
system.time(a <- primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9))
   user  system elapsed 
  2.452   0.208   2.676
  
## And using nThreads we are ~8x faster
system.time(b <- primeSieve(1e15, 1e15 + 1e9, nThreads = 8))
   user  system elapsed 
  5.054   0.754   0.977
  
identical(a, b)
[1] TRUE

identical(a, old)
[1] TRUE
```

### primeCount Under the Hood

The library by Kim Walisch relies on [OpenMP](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP>) for parallel computation with [Legendre's Formula](<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendresFormula.html>). Currently, the default compiler on `macOS` is `clang`, which does not support `OpenMP`. James Balamuta (a.k.a. TheCoatlessProfessor... well at least [we think so](<https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/about/>)) has written a great article on this topic, which you can find here: <https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/openmp-in-r-on-os-x/>. One of the goals of `RcppAlgos` is to be accessible by all users. With this in mind, we set out to count primes in parallel without `OpenMP`.

At first glance, this seems trivial as we have a function in `Primes.cpp` called `phiWorker` that counts the primes up to `x`. If you look in [phi.cpp](<https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount/blob/master/src/phi.cpp>) in the `primecount` library by Kim Walisch, we see that `OpenMP` does its magic on a for loop that makes repeated calls to `phi` (which is what `phiWorker` is based on). All we need to do is break this loop into _n_ intervals where _n_ is the number of threads. Simple, right?

We can certainly do this, but what you will find is that _n - 1_ threads will complete very quickly and the _n<sup>th</sup>_ thread will be left with a heavy computation. In order to alleviate this unbalanced load, we take advantage of thread pooling provided by `RcppThread` which allows us to reuse threads efficiently as well as breaking up the loop mentioned above into smaller intervals. The idea is to completely calculate `phi` up to a limit `m` using all _n_ threads and then gradually increase _m_. The advantage here is that we are benefiting greatly from the caching done by the work of the previous _n_ threads.

With this is mind, here are some results:
``` r
